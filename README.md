# TabSpace
Read a file and replace tabs with spaces

## Setting up the Console app
In the Program.cs file, set the values for variables `pathToFile`, `inputFileName`, and `outputFileName`

The code needed to modify is currently hard coded as follows:

```csharp
var pathToFile = @"C:\temp\";
var inputFileName = "tabtest.txt";
var outputFileName = "tabtest_tospaces.txt";
```
